### Rest API for Recipe

REST API for Recipe management
GET /recipes
Retrieve a list of all recipes in the database.
POST /recipes
Create a new recipe in the database.
GET /recipes/{recipeId}
Retrieve details for a specific recipe identified by recipeId.
PUT /recipes/{recipeId}
Update an existing recipe identified by recipeId.
DELETE /recipes/{recipeId}
Delete a recipe identified by recipeId.


### User Authentication API
The API allows users to sign up, log in, and delete their accounts. Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt, and token-based authentication is implemented for user sessions.

controllers: Contains the controller functions that handle HTTP requests and interact with the service layer.
models: Defines the MongoDB schema for the user and exports the user model.
services: Implements the business logic for user authentication and interacts with the MongoDB database using the user model.
utilities: Contains utility functions such as token generation.
routes: Defines the API routes using Express, routing HTTP requests to the corresponding controller functions.

API Endpoints:

POST /signup: Sign up a new user. Requires name, username, email, and password in the request body.
POST /login: Log in a user. Requires either username or email and password in the request body.
DELETE /:id: Delete a user by their ID. Requires the user ID as a parameter in the URL.

Error Handling:

Validation errors (e.g., empty fields, invalid email) return a 400 status code with an error message.
Unauthorized errors return a 401 status code with an "Unauthorized" message.
Internal server errors return a 500 status code with an "Internal Server Error" message.

Security:

User passwords are hashed using bcrypt for secure storage.
Token-based authentication is implemented for user sessions.


### REST API for Ingredient
The Ingredient API is a Node.js-based application utilizing Express and MongoDB with Mongoose, designed to manage information about ingredients and the stores where they are available. The project follows a structured architecture with separate modules for defining the schema (ingredient-model.js), handling CRUD operations (ingredient-service.js), managing HTTP requests and responses (ingredient-controller.js), and defining API routes (ingredient-routes.js).
